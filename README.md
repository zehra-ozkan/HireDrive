## HireDrive

  HireDrive is an desktop application aimed at fastening the orocess of emplyment, spesifically in between the drivers and cargo companies. Our applicatipn provides two types of users, company and driver. 
In the sign up page there are 2 options, the users will select accordingly.

To complete the sign up process the users will asked to enter the 6 digit code sent to their email adresses, which they will specify in the screen.   

  After completing the signup process the users can choose the parameters fitting best to their situation from the left hand side of the homepage, and can click on *search* to see the matching results. depending on their 
user type these parameters will be updated accordingly, for drivers they can filter the advertisement placed by cargo companies using the companies rating, the cargo type, required licenses for shipment,
start location and the destination. for the companies those parameters will for searching through the driver profiles, using the user rating, the licenses and the experience of the driver. 

  The users can click to these given lists and send a request. After the other party accepts the request they are placed in a *works_with* relationship where they can see the detailed informatipn from their 
*profile* pages. the driver and the company that are in a works_with relationship can chat with each other, until the completion of the job. They will also be allowed to rate in other in this process. After the work is done
they will no longer be considered _related_ and the chat feature along with the rating feauture will be disabled. 

The users profile page consists of their usernames, id's and other relevant information such as the company they work with (if they are drivers) or the drivers working with them(for companies).
For practical reasons we ahve allowed for one driver to work for only one company at a time and also the srivers will not be allowed to place advertisements, since those operations will be handled 
through their profiles.

Overall we have paid extra attention into making our application easy to understand and use, which we hope will be appreciaited.
